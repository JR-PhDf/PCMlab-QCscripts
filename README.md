moleular dipolemoment xyz 3D visualization
### Usage

To visualize the three-dimensional molecular structure with dipole moment components:

1. Input the molecule's XYZ coordinates, along with the dipole moment and its three-dimensional components (calculated using quantum chemistry software), into the `molecular_dipolemoment.txt` file.
2. Run the Python script to generate the 3D structure featuring the dipole moment representation.

For example:

```bash
python structural_dipole.py
```
